assessment model issue
1 user_id and case_id is and is_post_ai are composite primary key, and they need unique constraint
2 if is_post_ai=true, there must be a is_post_ai=false case with the same user_id and case_id, and the change_diagnosis_after_ai field and change_management_after_ai field must be computed(or can we make these computed field and not save in database?)
